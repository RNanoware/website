# Security Policy

This website is designed to only host static content. No significant code
is executed on either the client or server in a standard viewing session.
Furthermore, the website is currently hosted on GitHub Pages, so any
significant server-side vulnerabilities are more likely their responsibility
rather than this site.

That said, security reports are welcome here and I, Neill, will do my best
to monitor and respond to whatever matters arise. Simply open an issue on
this repository or, if you are uncomfortable discussing the vulnerability
in a public setting, email me at the address associated with my GitHub
account.

A few disclaimers:

* I make no guarantees on the efficiency of either my first response or
  ultimate action taken addressing any reports that come my way.
  
* I offer no standard compensation for security reports, no matter how
  severe. Any reward extended will be based entirely on personal whims
  and should not be interpreted as a pattern.
