title: Revolving Door Etiquette
---

Like most skyscrapers, the building in which I work has a handful of ground-level entry options. The standard lineup of hinge doors flanks the centerpiece: a four-slot rotating pillar of glass. I gravitate toward that specific cylindrical portal for both arrival and departure.

Until recently, however, I never gave much thought to _why_ I make that daily choice. <!--more-->

Certainly, I have many valid reasons to prefer the revolving door:

- Novelty. Who didn't delight in spinning around in revolving doors as a child?
- Energy efficiency. Studies show that revolving doors waste less interior air to the outdoor climate[^1].
- Cleanliness. I can always push a revolving door with an arm or shoulder, unlike the various handles of hinge doors.

But one particular motivation has dominated my mind much more often than I'd like to admit.

- Social anxiety. I don't want to think about holding the door for someone else.

[^1]: I actually don't have a source for this claim.
