title: Invisalign of the Heart
---

For the second time in my life, I am undergoing the tedious and painful
experience of tooth re-alignment. As a coping mechanism, why not pontificate on
how Invisalign can serve as a spiritual allegory?

There are worse ways to cope, I suppose.

After completely forgetting the horrors of middle school braces, over the past
several years I allowed myself to lose my retainer and let my teeth slip--just
enough to warrant a few months of Invisalign to get things on the right track.
Hearing from my orthodontist the options, Invisalign seemed like an effortless
remedy for the consequences of my past neglect: transparent plastic, removable
at any time, no pain from popped wires, no eating restrictions... Life would be
great!

But as any teenager or adult with recent orthodontic treatment will tell you,
Invisalign is _not_ a walk in the park, especially jumping into the process
"fresh" without recent braces or retainer use.

Your teeth are always slightly mobile: if not, how would they move out of
alignment in the first place? The roots sit in a container of dense cartilage,
similar to the material that shapes your nose. No matter how tough, however,
cartilage is still movable. Natural chewing, clenching, and activity will put
pressure on the teeth that allow the cartilage to shift, break down, and re-form
over the course of years.

Orthodontic treatments all capitalize on this same flexibility when putting
one's teeth back in place. They put constant pressure on the teeth to move them
in new directions, out of the way of others and into two perfect rows of
freshly-shorn sheep[^1]. Furthermore, this pressure is applied in an extreme and
optimal way, to expedite the alignment process and overcome the natural
pressures of biting and chewing.

Invisalign in particular is a coveted form of treatment:

-   It can be removed at any time
-   It is transparent: nearly invisible to onlookers
-   Breakages or malfunctions do not typically cause pain (unlike popped wires
    from braces)

So, given all of those benefits, who am I to complain?
