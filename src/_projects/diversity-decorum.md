Over the summer of 2018 I had the privilege of working under Dr. Emerson
Murphy-Hill at NC State University, researching cultural bias in open source
software development. The resulting paper illustrates the efficacy of written
social policies in mitigating the gender gap. That November, I was able to
present this research at ESEC/FSE 2018, earning third place in the Student
Research Competition.
