## Location

Based in the beautiful city of Raleigh, NC!

## Vocation

I am a senior software engineer at [Pendo](https://www.pendo.io/), focusing on front-end web development and design.

## Association

I serve as a small group leader at [Crossroads Fellowship](https://crossroads.org/), and am blessed with an incredible church family there.

I'm a member of the [Raleigh Charter High School](https://www.raleighcharterhs.org/) Foundation Board, assisting with financial governance and fundraising. Raleigh Charter is my high school alma mater. It's a privilege to still be a part of that community!
