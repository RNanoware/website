    As the printing press of the 21st century, it's no wonder the Internet
    continues to capture my fascination. I'm passionate about fostering
    effective, efficient, and accessible communication online.

    To show is infinitely better than to tell! Whether the occasion calls for
    improvised role-playing or a full-blown performance, I'm always eager to set
    aside my more introverted nature and connect with others through acting.

    无论你从哪里来，我还想跟你当朋友！ The global community in which we live is
    ripe with potential for sharing lessons and innovations across barriers of
    language and culture. I love studying Mandarin Chinese for this reason.

    Life can be much more complicated than words can express, and music is how I
    release and examine those lingering thoughts within me. If a jingle or ode
    can be used to more effectively convey a point, you can count on me finding
    it!
