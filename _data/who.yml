    Give me a task. If I can't accomplish it with a program... well, I'll probably die trying! Some of my favorite languages for personal projects are J and Haxe, but I am also proficient in Java, PHP, C, and Javascript, among others.

    Nothing excites me quite like the light in a friend's eyes as they have that epiphany that comes with effective computer communication. For as long as I've been studying software, I've sought out ways to share that passion with other students and peers. At NC State, I serve as an outreach coordinator for middle-school-level Computer Science workshops with STARS Computing Corps.

    The centerpiece of my fascination with computers is their capacity to help us express ourselves in unique ways, such as the visual layouts of websites and the interactive nature of video games. Outside of computing, I also enjoy participating in community theatre, playing the piano, and reading.
