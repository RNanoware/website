    Give me a task. If I can't accomplish it with a program... well, I'll
    probably die trying! Some of my favorite languages for personal projects are
    <a href="http://jsoftware.com/">J</a> and <a
    href="https://haxe.org/">Haxe</a>, but I am also proficient in Java, PHP, C,
    and Javascript, among others.

    Nothing excites me quite like the light in a friend's eyes as they have that
    epiphany that comes with effective computer communication. For as long as
    I've been studying software, I've sought out ways to share that passion with
    other students and peers. At NC State, I serve as an outreach coordinator
    for middle-school-level Computer Science workshops with STARS Computing
    Corps.

    The centerpiece of my fascination with computers is their capacity to help
    us express ourselves in unique ways, such as the visual layouts of websites
    and the interactive nature of video games. Outside of computing, I also
    enjoy participating in community theatre, playing the piano, and reading.
