    This video game represents my first entry into the triannual Ludum Dare
    48-hour game design competition. Learning how to envision, implement, and
    publish a product in such a short timeframe was an invaluable experience!

    As a high school side project, I spent time solving problems on <a
    href="https://projecteuler.net">Project Euler</a> in the J programming
    language. There was one problem I never figured out, but it led to the
    discovery of a new integer sequence that is now published under my name.
    Not all who wander are lost, I suppose!

    My passion for computer science would have never existed without a few
    college students coming to my middle school and introducing the field. To
    travel across my home state and provide the same opportunities to
    disadvantaged middle school students was an incredible privilege and
    blessing!
