    This video game represents my first entry into the triannual Ludum Dare
    48-hour game design competition. Learning how to envision, implement, and
    publish a product in such a short timeframe was an invaluable experience!

- title: OEIS Entry
  description: >
    As a high school side project, I spent time solving problems on <a
    href="https://projecteuler.net">Project Euler</a> in the J programming
    language. There was one problem I never figured out, but it led to the
    discovery of a new integer sequence that is now published under my name.
    Not all who wander are lost, I suppose!

- title: Diversity and Decorum Research Paper
  description: >
    Over the summer of 2018 I had the privilege of working under Dr. Emerson
    Murphy-Hill at NC State University, researching cultural bias in open source
    software development. The resulting paper illustrates the efficacy of
    written social policies in mitigating the gender gap. I had the privilege of
    presenting this research at ESEC/FSE 2018.
