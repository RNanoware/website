title: The Infamous Liebster Award

As an encouragement to continue sharing my thoughts and experiences online, a person near and dear to my heart nominated me for [the Libster Award](https://theglobalaussie.com/liebster-award-2018/).

First and foremost, I highly recommend that you check out the blog of my nominator, [Further Up and Further In](https://volarconmigo.wordpress.com/2018/01/07/liebster-award/) by La Creadora Fantasma. Like myself, LCF is just beginning to learn how to record her own thoughts and inspire others through online publishing, and I am eager to watch her blossom both professionally and creatively through this experience. Keep it up!

As it turns out, the "rules" of nomination for the Liebster Award are slightly different from year to year: since 2018 just recently kicked off its opening act, I'll try and satisfy both the rules given to me by my nominator and the new rules published by the originator.

Let's go!

## On Blogging

Why do I write blogs?

My journey began when I took a trip abroad to Hangzhou, China, and was seeking a way to memorialize that unique experience and share it with friends and family back home. Being a quixotic techie with a dogged proclivity to independence, I threw together a self-hosted website on which I built a resume page in spartan HTML/CSS and a [Ghost blog](https://ghost.org/) for recording my time in China. Since then, I've spent much more time investing in the website's technology rather than its content (form over function--an incorrigible flaw against which I battle), and have most recently settled on a [Jekyll site](https://jekyllrb.com/) hosted on [Github](https://github.com/) (a platform to help software developers track their code and collaborate) and managed with [Prose](http://prose.io/).

But, technologies aside, why do I still strive to immortalize my thoughts in text, and publish them online for the world to see? In truth, my motivation comes down to my love for storytelling: using narratives in every form to build connections with others. From the color palletes of the websites I build to the tension of the piano's vibrations, from the worlds invented through extemporized theatrical performance to those themes shared through a video game, I am in love with communication--especially through non-traditional media. Building a website and contribuing to a blog is one way I believe that I can combine my two somewhat divergent passions--software development and narrative creation--into a single product.
