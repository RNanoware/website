title: The Infamous Liebster Award

As an encouragement to continue sharing my thoughts and experiences online, a person near and dear to my heart nominated me for [the Libster Award](https://theglobalaussie.com/liebster-award-2018/).

First and foremost, I highly recommend that you check out the blog of my nominator, [Further Up and Further In](https://volarconmigo.wordpress.com/2018/01/07/liebster-award/) by La Creadora Fantasma. Like myself, LCF is just beginning to learn how to record her own thoughts and inspire others through online publishing, and I am eager to watch her blossom both professionally and creatively through this experience. Keep it up!

As it turns out, the "rules" of nomination for the Liebster Award are slightly different from year to year: since 2018 just recently kicked off its opening act, I'll try and satisfy both the rules given to me by my nominator and the new rules published by the originator. The links to both rulesets are given above.

Let's go!

## Intention Explained

Why do I write blogs?

My journey began when I took a trip abroad to Hangzhou, China, and was seeking a way to memorialize that unique experience and share it with friends and family back home. Being a quixotic techie with a dogged proclivity to independence, I threw together a self-hosted website on which I built a resume page in spartan HTML/CSS and a [Ghost blog](https://ghost.org/) for recording my time in China. Since then, I've spent much more time investing in the website's technology rather than its content (form over function--an incorrigible flaw against which I battle), and have most recently settled on a [Jekyll site](https://jekyllrb.com/) hosted on [Github](https://github.com/) (a platform to help software developers track their code and collaborate) and managed with [Prose](http://prose.io/).

But, technologies aside, why do I still strive to immortalize my thoughts in text, and publish them online for the world to see? In truth, my motivation comes down to my love for storytelling: using narratives in every form to build connections with others. From the color palletes of the websites I build to the tension of the piano's vibrations, from the worlds invented through extemporized theatrical performance to those themes shared through a video game, I am in love with communication--especially through non-traditional media. Building a website and contribuing to a blog is one way I believe that I can combine my two somewhat divergent passions--software development and narrative creation--into a single product.

I also like being able to save and revise drafts of my thoughts: a practice that most other forms of online social media don't necessarily allow!

## Questions Answered

I will now attempt to answer the eleven inquiries of my nominator, La Creadora Fantasma:

1. Apple, Android, Microsoft, or Linux software?

    You're killing me already! My knee-jerk response is Linux, because I've grown up using various Linux distributions for most of my journey so far as a computer scientist and I value the power and freedom of a community in which everyone is able to contribute to the functional development of the software system. 

    That said, as I continue to learn grow in my understanding of various computer technologies, companies, and cultures, I am also beginning to take into account the pragmatic realities of the field. "Open Source" does not necessarily imply an open and inclusive development community. It doesn't always yield accessible software, and the provided products and services often fail to bring food to the table of their contributors. There is a time for everything, and a season for every activity under the heavens[^1]; free and open-source software has an important place in our community, but it is not the answer to all technological woes.

    [^1]: Ecclesiastes 3:1.

    From a practical perspective, I actually find myself leaning slightly toward Microsoft. Although I am perhaps least familiar with system administration and software development on Windows, I find Microsoft's recent actions as a company pleasantly surprising and admirable. They seem eager to make their products accessible and open both to developers (who desire clear documentation and transparent sources) and end users (who desire dependability and elegant functionality). Microsoft doesn't exhibit the vertical integration of their products and services that Apple does (allowing Apple to provide beautiful interfaces to their customers), but in doing so Microsoft forms better relationships with their developer community. Microsoft still keeps much of their software closed-source, but without doing so they would struggle to make ends meet and continue delivering the quality standard that end users have come to expect.

    So, long story short: In a perfect world, Linux. In this world, Microsoft!

2. If you could play any instrument (other than one you already play), what would it be?

    I would definitely choose an instrument that I could carry with me, and perferrably one with which I could sing along. A guitar, despite its simplicity, would be ideal for these requirements! But since portability is more important to me than the ability to sing, I would also seriously consider a harmonica, because it could be a meditation and respite that could literally fit in my pocket.

3. Herbal, green, black, or white tea?


4. What was your favorite song as a small kid?
5. What is the best joke you’ve ever heard?
6. Do you know what a viola is?
7. Have you ever been out of the country? If so, where?
8. What are some inside family quotes that you’ll never forget?
9. Best board game? Best video game?
10. How do you feel about autocorrect when texting?
11. If someone gave you a free, two-way ticket to Mars would you go?
